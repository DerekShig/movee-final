# movee

### **What's this?**

This is my final project for WEB322 - Web Programming Tools and Frameworks. To summarize, it is a full-stack application that applies many of the topics covered in this class. Some examples of concepts used in this assignment: MVC, separations of concerns, application design and more. 

movee allows a user to perform basic tasks such as registering for an account and logging in and out using sessions. Once logged in, a user can 'buy' or 'rent' movies or shows from a database. An admin user can add, edit and delete from the database seamlessly but is restricted from purchasing products.

### **Technology Used**
